# 🏏 IPL First Innings Score Analysis (2008–2017)

This repository presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic regression modeling on **Indian Premier League (IPL)** first innings scores using ball-by-ball match data from 2008 to 2017.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Ca2 for toolbox code.py`: Python code used for data loading, cleaning, visualization, and regression analysis.
- `ipldataset.csv`: IPL dataset used for analysis (sourced from Kaggle).
- `Python report.docx`: Detailed project report including methodology, results, visualizations, and insights.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze and visualize IPL first innings data to derive meaningful cricketing insights such as team performance, scoring trends, and relationships between runs, overs, and wickets.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Data visualization
- **scikit-learn**: Linear regression modeling & MSE evaluation

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

1. **Data Inspection**
   - Dataset structure, column names, and missing values.
   
2. **Team Performance**
   - Bar charts for total runs scored and wickets taken per team.

3. **Top Teams**
   - Pie charts showing the top 5 batting and bowling teams.

4. **Scoring Trends**
   - Scatter plot of overs vs total runs.
   - Linear regression: Wickets vs Total Runs.

5. **Outlier Detection**
   - Boxplots for team-wise score outliers.

6. **Feature Correlation**
   - Heatmap of numerical features to identify strong relationships.

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

- 📊 **Bar Charts** – Team runs and wickets
- 🥧 **Pie Charts** – Top 5 batting/bowling teams
- 📉 **Regression Plot** – Wickets vs Runs
- 🧊 **Heatmap** – Correlation between variables
- 📦 **Box Plot** – Team-wise score outliers

---

## 🧠 Insights

- **Mumbai Indians** and **Chennai Super Kings** emerged as top-performing teams in both batting and bowling.
- Final runs were positively correlated with overs played and performance in the last 5 overs.
- A clear inverse relationship between wickets lost and total runs was observed.
- The final 5 overs are critical for maximizing innings total.
